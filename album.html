            <p>
              Doraemon is a fictional character in the Japanese manga and anime
              series of the same name created by Fujiko F. Fujio. Doraemon is a
              male robotic earless cat that travels back in time from the 22nd
              century to aid a preteen boy named Nobita.Most of the times,
              Nobita saves Doraemon in such situations. Although he has no
              fingers in most media, he can hold things because of the suction
              cups in his hands. His favorite food is Dorayaki. He has been
              shown to date a normal female cat. He is the elder brother of
              Dorami.

            <h3>Sizuka</h3>
            <p>
              Shizuka Minamoto is a smart, kind and pretty girl. She is often
              represented by the colour pink, and is seen wearing a pink shirt
              and skirt. She is Nobita's best friend and love-interest. She does
              not shun Nobita due to his failing grades, lazy disposition or
              constant failures. In fact, she often tries to encourage him to do
              better, though she usually fails to convince him.Shizuka's skirt
              is also frequently seen getting flipped, either by Nobita misusing
              Doraemon's gadgets, or by the wind.

            <p>
              Gianis a strong and quick-tempered local bully. He frequently
              steals other children's stuff under the pretext of "borrowing"
              them, unless the toy is damaged. He is known for his awful singing
              voice, though he considers himself a great singer. To prove this,
              Gian sometimes "invites" others to attend his concerts, under the
              threat of beatings.He frequently steals other children's stuff
              (especially Nobita's and Suneo's) under the pretext of "borrowing"
              them, unless the toy is damaged.

              Suneo Honekawa (骨川 スネ夫, Honekawa Suneo) is the fox-faced
              (inherited from his mother) rich child who loves to flaunt his
              material wealth before everyone, especially Nobita. A lot of the
              stories start with Suneo showing off some new video game, toy or
              pet which evokes Nobita's envy.Suneo is seen as a narcissist who
              loves to stare at himself in the mirror while telling himself that
              he is the most handsome guy in the world.

              Dekisugi is Nobita's classmate and friendly rival as he is a good
              friend of Shizuka's. He is very intelligent and has a photographic
              memory. Dekisugi is the perfect all-round student, consistently
              getting 100s in class (A+'s in English Dub) and also being highly
              capable in sports. His family is apparently wealthy, owning a
              house that is so large that one can lose one's way. Shizuka
              sometimes prefers the company of Dekisugi, who is more of her
              intellectual equal.

            <p>
              Gian's younger sister, and also the only child Gian treats well in
              the whole story, and Jaiko too loves her elder brother. In earlier
              stories, she had bad tempers when something did not go as she
              pleases, though she mellows down in later stories. Had Doraemon
              not intervened, she would have been Nobita's wife in the future
              which is why her first appearance is earlier than Suneo and Gian
              in the series. However, Doraemon succeeds on his mission and
              Nobita eventually marries Shizuka.

            <p>
              Dorami (ドラミ) is Doraemon's younger sister. Like Doraemon before
              he developed a fear of mice, she is yellow-skinned, and to keep
              Doraemon from thinking about his ears, her ears were replaced by a
              large red bow, her the fox tail were replaced by a flower
              tail.Different from her malfunctioning brother, she is the
              smartest student during her school time, and has better skills in
              using gadgets.
